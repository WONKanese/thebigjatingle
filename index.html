    <p class="history-text"><span class="date">8932BC - </span>The first reported sighting of the Big Jatingle dates all the way back to 8932BC. Cave drawings of the entity were discovered in 1972, that depicted a strange cloud raining, although the rain was white, therefore they concluded the cloud was actually a mysterious entity called the Big Jatingle creaming on the cave people.</p>
